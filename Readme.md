# SiteChecker
This is a program that takes input from the user as a search query and gets results from DuckDuckGo search engine. It then sends those results to VirusTotal 
to see if any results have viruses. If it gets any positivies it prints a message to the user including the link. It also writes the link to a file.

# User input Version?
This is a user input version of the program. I also have a version of the program where the search queries are generated programmatically at random.
(currently in development)

# Note to employers 

The VirusTotal API requires a key which I left out. If you want it please email me.
